# Disclamer
I do not recommend using this project as-is. However, if you really want to, you'll need **Qt Creator** and the **Microsoft Flight Simulator SDK (SimConnect)**.  
You may also need to tweak a few things to get it working, as we haven’t tested it outside the original development environment.  
This repository is public primarily to showcase the project in my portfolio — and hopefully it can help someone, since I personally struggled to find examples when building it.

# Additional info
If you really want to undestand how the project work , you can read our project report. Keep in mind it's a student project and is in french.
